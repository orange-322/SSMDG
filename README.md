## Pre_trained weights

The weights of the pre-trained VMamba could be downloaded [here](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba) or [Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ci_YvPPEiUT2bIIK5x8Igw?pwd=wnyy). After that, the pre-trained weights should be stored in './pretrained_weights/'.

Thanks a lot for the valuable work of [VM-UNet](https://github.com/JCruan519/VM-UNet) and [VMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba)
