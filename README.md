## Pre_trained Weights

The weights of the pre-trained VMamba could be downloaded [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16R-zLOYFSKE6mFdHaiPAjc2QwyBHy5SL/view?usp=drive_link). After that, the pre-trained weights should be stored in './pretrained_weights/'.

Thanks a lot for the valuable work of [VM-UNet](https://github.com/JCruan519/VM-UNet) and [VMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba).
